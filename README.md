# This project was built using the following technologies:

CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS (with DaisyUI)
JavaScript Library: ReactJS

## This project live Link  [vercel] https://dropbox-horizonplus-task.vercel.app/

### I have created 4 pages within one project. In the navbar, you'll find menus for About, Contact, and Blog. You can click on these menus to navigate to their respective routes.
### Code: src> Pages> AllPage* /Components/SharedComponent
### We have four pages: Landing Page (home), About, Contact, and Blog. To navigate between these pages, simply follow the menu in the navbar. 
#  **In the Blog Page, after the banner, you can find an "Add Blog" button. Clicking this button opens a modal where you can add a blog title, blog type, and blog image. After saving, the new blog will be added to the blog section without any coding. To handle this functionality, I used UseContext.
## This project mainly focuses on desktop version responsiveness but also ensures mobile responsiveness.
